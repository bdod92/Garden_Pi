# Garden_Pi

## Goal
To create an autonomous gardening system that can self regulate, but also be controlled through a web interface by anyone with the correct credentials from anywhere in the world.

## Method
1. Write a program that takes in air temperature and soil humidity readings from sensors and waters the garden autonomously through ball valves controlled by a raspberry pi.
2. Bonus: Use a weather API to predict upcoming rainfall and leverage that data in the program.
4. Incorporate a livestream function into the program


## Equipment
1. Raspberry Pi 4B+
2. Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 (Wide Angle)
3. Adafruit STEMMA Soil Sensor - I2C Capacative Moisture Sensor
